# GTD-project
The objective of the project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open-source dataset that contains comprehensive information on both domestic and international terrorist attacks occurring globally from 1970 through 2017. Developed and maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, the database encompasses details of over 180,000 recorded terrorism incidents. The project's principal aim is to delve deep into this expansive dataset, identify significant trends, patterns, and insights pertaining to terrorism-related activities, and visually present these discoveries for an enhanced understanding.

A critical aspect of this project is the extensive use of Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. The cornerstone of data manipulation, including loading the dataset, cleaning data, and executing sophisticated aggregation operations, will be the Pandas library. This powerful, high-performance tool offers efficient data structures and makes the handling of large datasets effortless.

To facilitate advanced numerical operations and speed up computation, the project employs the NumPy library. Given its proficiency in handling multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, NumPy is the perfect companion for data processing operations.

The project doesn't stop at numerical data analysis; it brings the extracted insights to life through vivid, informative visualizations, courtesy of the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. These libraries provide an array of visualization styles, enabling the display of data in ways that are both appealing and informative. From bar plots and scatter plots to histograms and heatmaps, the project will utilize a minimum of five different visualizations to reveal relationships between variables and provide a graphical representation of the dataset's characteristics.

Exploring the GTD through this project will pave the way for an intricate understanding of terrorism patterns over the past decades. The goal is to unveil potential trends in attack frequency, most targeted countries, preferred methods of attack, types of weapons used, casualties, and the evolution of terrorist organizations, among relevant dimensions.

By examining these factors, the project aims to provide a detailed overview of global terrorism trends, informing counter-terrorism strategies and policies. Additionally, the findings may also help understand the characteristics prone to attacks and the reasons behind their vulnerability.

In conclusion, this project offers a data-driven exploration into the dark world of terrorism, aiming to shed light on the complex patterns hidden within the enormity of the GTD. The end product of this project will be an array of valuable insights that have the potential to contribute substantially to ongoing counter-terrorism efforts and inform future research in this field. The combination of data manipulation, numerical computation, and graphic visualization is expected to yield a robust and comprehensive exploration of the dataset, leading to substantial key findings pertaining to global terrorism.
